GPS for bicycle that uses haptic feedback to signal a turn

We built a GPS for bicycle that uses haptic feedback to help delivery bikes (couriers, Deliveroo etc.). It's basically two modules that you put inside of the handlebar; it connects via bluetooth to your phone and when your GPS/Map app tells you to turn right, the right side of the handlebar vibrates.
We created a working prototype. iOS app connected to an Arduino nano, vibration motors, LEDs and BLE Chip. Now we're trying to make a finished product, with a custom PCB and custom enclosure, with a bigger vibration motor (higher amplitude of vibration) and great user experience similar to the AirPods. (in terms of using them daily and having this "docking station" easily transportable).
